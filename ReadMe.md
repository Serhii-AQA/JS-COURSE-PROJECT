### Usage

I'll create a markdown table with these scripts:

| Script Command                         | Description                                         |

| `npx playwright test --project webkit` | Run tests on different browsers                     |
| `npx playwright test --ui`             | Running the Example Test in UI Mode                 |
| `npx playwright show-report`           | HTML Report: generated automatically after test run |
| `npx playwright codegen`               | Open code generation tool                           |

#### Test Naming Convention

- UI tests: *.spec.ts
- API tests: *.api.spec.ts

### Configuration

- Configuration is handled via playwright.config.ts. You can modify:
- Test timeout
- Base URL
- Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Parallelism
- Reporter types

### Test template

```JS
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('{{ suite }}', () => {

	test.beforeEach(async ({ api }) => {
		// Setup actions before each test
		// For example: reset state, prepare test environment
	});

	test.afterEach(async ({ api }) => {
		// Cleanup actions after each test
		// For example: logout, clear data
	});

    test('Homepage loads successfully', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('/');
        await expect(page.locator('h1')).toHaveText('Welcome');
    });
});

```

### Best Practices

- Keep tests atomic and independent.
- Use custom fixtures for setup/teardown.
- Use locators based on role, test id, or text â€” avoid deep CSS selectors.
- Use .only and .skip carefully to avoid skipping critical tests in CI.
